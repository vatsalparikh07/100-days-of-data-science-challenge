# EmoNet: Advanced Emotion Classification Using NLP Techniques

## Overview
EmoNet is an advanced emotion classification model that leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to accurately identify and categorize emotions expressed in textual data. The model is designed to predict the emotional sentiment associated with each document in a given dataset, enabling applications such as sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and mood detection in conversational interfaces.

## Problem Statement
The goal of EmoNet is to develop a high-performing emotion classification model capable of accurately categorizing emotions expressed in textual data. This involves training the model on a diverse corpus of documents annotated with corresponding emotion labels and optimizing its performance to achieve high accuracy and robustness in classifying emotions across various contexts.

## Aim
- Develop a high-performing emotion classification model using NLP techniques.
- Train the model on annotated textual data to accurately predict emotional sentiment.
- Optimize the model's performance to achieve high accuracy and robustness.

## Dataset Attributes
- **Text Data:** Each entry contains a piece of text representing a statement or expression of emotion.
- **Emotion Label:** Indicates the predominant emotion conveyed in the corresponding text data.

## Data Analysis
- Explored the dataset to understand its characteristics and distribution of emotions.
- Preprocessed the text data to remove noise and irrelevant information.
- Visualized the frequency of each emotion category using bar charts and pie charts.
- Applied statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Feature Engineering
- Preprocessed the text data to remove noise, tokenize the text, and remove stopwords.
- Utilized TF-IDF vectorization and Word2Vec embeddings to transform the text data into numerical features.
- Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover themes in the text data.

## Modeling
- Trained three different models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Utilized TF-IDF vectorization and Word2Vec embeddings as feature engineering methods.
- Conducted grid search and cross-validation to tune hyperparameters for each model.
- Plotted ROC-AUC curves to evaluate model performance.

## Evaluation and Reporting
- Selected the Random Forest model with TF-IDF feature engineering as the optimal model.
- Made predictions on unseen data and evaluated accuracy.
- Achieved high accuracy and robust performance on the test dataset.

## Conclusion
EmoNet demonstrates the effectiveness of advanced NLP techniques in emotion classification tasks. By accurately predicting emotional sentiment in textual data, EmoNet can be applied to various real-world scenarios, including sentiment analysis and mood detection. The model's high accuracy and robustness make it a valuable tool for understanding and interpreting emotional nuances in text.
