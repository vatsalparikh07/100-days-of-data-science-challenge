# Astronaut Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Analysis: A SQL Journey Through Spacewalks  
*Analyzing 60+ years of human spaceflight history through Extravehicular Activities*

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This project dives into the fascinating world of space exploration by analyzing astronaut extra-vehicular activities (EVA) using SQL. By leveraging datasets on astronaut missions, we uncover patterns in EVA durations, purposes, and programs over time.

**Key Objectives:**
- Understand the distribution of EVA durations across space programs.
- Identify astronauts with the most EVA time.
- Analyze the evolution of EVA purposes (e.g., repairs, installations, photography).
- Explore trends in EVA activity by year and program.
