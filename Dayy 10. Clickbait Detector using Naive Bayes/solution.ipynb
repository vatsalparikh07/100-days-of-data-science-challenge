        "The `train_naive_bayes` function implements the training phase of the Naive Bayes classifier, customized for text classification tasks. Given training data (`X`), labels (`labels`), and a `vectorizer`, this function calculates key probability components needed for text classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
        "   - The input `X` (a sparse matrix) is converted into a `DataFrame` (`X_df`) with columns representing features (tokens) extracted from the vectorizer. This conversion facilitates easier handling and manipulation of token counts.\n",
        "   - The `labels` are added to `X_df` as a new column (`'--label--'`), ensuring alignment between features and class labels. Each label is cast to an integer for consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Calculating `log_prob_class`**:\n",
        "   - The term `log_prob_class` represents the prior log-probabilities, or `log P(y=k)`, for each class `k`. To calculate this, the function:\n",
        "     - Counts occurrences of each label (i.e., class) using `value_counts()` and sorts them to maintain label order.\n",
        "     - Calculates the probability of each class by dividing its count by the total number of documents (`total_docs`).\n",
        "     - Takes the natural logarithm of each class probability to compute `log_prob_class`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calculating `log_prob_token_count_per_class`**:\n",
        "   - This term represents the conditional log-probabilities, or `log P(x_t | y=k)`, where `x_t` is a token and `y=k` represents the class. The calculation for this term proceeds as follows:\n",
        "   - A loop iterates over each unique class `cls` (e.g., \"clickbait\" or \"non-clickbait\" in a clickbait detection context):\n",
        "     - Filters rows in `X_df` corresponding to the class.\n",
        "     - Sums the token counts across documents of that class to get total token occurrences. Laplace smoothing is applied by adding 1 to each count, ensuring no zero probabilities.\n",
        "     - Calculates the total count of all tokens for that class (`total_tokens`) to normalize each token count into a probability.\n",
        "     - Converts the probability of each token (given the class) into a log-probability and stores these values in a dictionary (`log_prob_token_count_per_class`) under the current class key.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Return Values**:\n",
        "   - The function returns two dictionaries:\n",
        "     - `log_prob_token_count_per_class`: A dictionary with class labels as keys and each value representing log-probabilities of each token given the class.\n",
        "     - `log_prob_class`: A `Series` containing the log-probability of each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these two components (`log_prob_class` and `log_prob_token_count_per_class`) allow for calculating the posterior log-probabilities for predicting the class of new documents, completing the training phase for Naive Bayes.\n"

        "The `predict_single_doc` function performs document-level prediction for a single document using the trained Naive Bayes model. Given a document (`doc`), a `vectorizer` to convert the document into token counts, `log_prob_token_count_per_class` (representing conditional log-probabilities), and `log_prob_class` (class priors), this function calculates the log-probabilities for each class and determines the most likely class for the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Document Vectorization**:\n",
        "   - The document (`doc`) is first vectorized using `vectorizer.transform([doc])`. This transformation converts the document into a numerical vector, `doc_vector`, where each entry represents the count of a specific token in the document. Flattening the array allows easy element-wise operations in subsequent steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Class Log-Probability Calculation**:\n",
        "   - A dictionary, `class_log_probs`, is initialized to store the computed log-probabilities for each class.\n",
        "   - The function then iterates over each class (e.g., 0 and 1, for non-clickbait and clickbait in a clickbait detection context) to calculate the log-probability of the document belonging to that class:\n",
        "     - **Start with the Class Prior Log-Probability**: `log_prob` is initialized with the class's prior log-probability from `log_prob_class[cls]`.\n",
        "     - **Add Token Log-Probabilities**: For each token present in the document vector, the function calculates the contribution to the overall log-probability. This is done by performing an element-wise multiplication between `doc_vector` and `token_log_probs` for the class, which represents the log-probability of each token occurring in documents of that class. The summed result is added to `log_prob` for that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Storing and Selecting the Final Prediction**:\n",
        "   - After calculating `log_prob` for each class, the results are stored in `class_log_probs`.\n",
        "   - The function selects the class with the highest log-probability in `class_log_probs` as the prediction, representing the class most likely to contain the given document.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Return the Prediction**:\n",
        "   - The function returns `pred`, the predicted class label with the highest log-probability score.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, `predict_single_doc` assesses each class's likelihood given the token distribution in `doc`, favoring the class with the maximum log-probability, and returns this as the predicted label.\n"

        "### Key Optimizations and Changes Implemented\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Use of `csr_matrix` for Sparse Data Efficiency**:\n",
        "   We assume `X` is a sparse matrix in `csr_matrix` format, allowing for efficient memory usage and faster matrix operations on high-dimensional data. This change significantly reduces memory overhead, as Yelp reviews have a large vocabulary (many features).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Class-wise Token Count Calculation**:\n",
        "   - We iterate over unique classes using `np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)`, which provides `unique_labels` and their respective counts, `class_counts`, in a single pass. This saves time by avoiding repeated operations on the label data.\n",
        "   - For each class, `cls_indices` efficiently selects documents corresponding to the class `cls`. Only these rows of the sparse matrix `X` are summed, giving the total token count per class (`cls_token_counts`). This approach reduces unnecessary computation by processing only relevant class documents in each loop iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Efficient Storage and Retrieval of Log Probabilities**:\n",
        "   - We use an array `log_prob_token_count_per_class_array` with dimensions `(num_classes, num_features)` to store log-probabilities for each token-class combination. This array-based approach is optimized for fast access and minimizes the use of dictionaries, which reduces overhead when iterating and retrieving values during inference.\n",
        "   - The log-probabilities are calculated with Laplace smoothing (`+1`) and then stored directly in the pre-allocated array (`log_prob_token_count_per_class_array[cls_index]`). The use of `.A1` converts the result to a flat array, simplifying storage and ensuring compatibility with future operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Optimized Log Probability Calculations**:\n",
        "   - We compute `log_prob_class` directly from class counts, using vectorized `np.log(class_counts / total_docs)`. This approach removes the need for loops over individual classes when calculating prior probabilities, optimizing for large datasets with multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Overall Structure for Improved Runtime**:\n",
        "   - By using optimized NumPy operations and leveraging sparse data handling, the function achieves faster runtime and lower memory usage, which is critical for handling larger datasets with multiple labels.\n",
