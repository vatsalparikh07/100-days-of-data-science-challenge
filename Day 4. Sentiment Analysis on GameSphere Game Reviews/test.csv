Team up with dozens of players and battle through the Realm of the Mad God, Oryx. With a retro 8-bit style, Realm is an evolution of traditional MMO gameplay.

Earn fame if you survive for long enough and kill enough monsters.Sheep. The sheep say 'Baa.' ",2017.0,"       ROTMG is a free bullet hell-style mmorpg. Unlike many mmorpgs, the pacing is fine - nice and fast. It also features permadeath with roguelite elements, unlocking new classes and other such things each time you die. I personally don't mind the art style, though I know pixel art is not for everyone.        All in all, I find the gameplay loop thoroughly enjoyable, and I would recommend playing this with friends (which is easy because it's free) for a deep, fun experience."

It's probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hours logged on it.Even though people may not like the hats and new items, personally I think that's what keeps this game alive. Every time the game feels like it's getting boring or repetitive, they add something new that makes the game feel fresh and fun. This is the only game I think I'd ever give a perfect 10/10, because the game's always expanding. The community on the other hand, is quite a lot like the Sonic fanbase, and I'll just leave it at that.In conclusion, if you haven't played this game before, DO IT; I cannot stress that enough, download it and play it.

Moving on from the initial surprise - the game has an in-game chat, mostly alerting everyone when someone gets an epic gear, but also giving you the ability to ask questions or talk the day away. Given that the Crusaders is not a competitive game, the community is extremely friendly, by far the best one I’ve encountered online. I have observed people from all walks of life share their story through the chat, and it is… Well, beautiful. No matter what type of gamer you are, this is something you can easily play between chores, or while doing literally anything - working, watching a movie, playing another game. I’ve enjoyed my fair share of idle games while doing tedious tasks, and Crusaders of the lost idols is definitely keeping it interesting, being rewarding and a bit challenging to top it off."

Great graphics, amazing sound and voice design, and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make Dota 2 great. But it's major strong point is the depth in its mechanics.While Dota 2's gameplay might seem daunting at first, it's one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game, and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting. Other games such as League of Legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula, but Dota 2 kept it intact, and makes sure you learn something new everyday.Not only the core game is strong, but also the eSport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing, with several tournaments going on, including Valve's own The International. At the time of release, the game looks like a train with no brakes, about to crash against its competitors and run them over, raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game."

",2017.0,"***EDITThe last time I touched this garbage was September of last year, and honestly it has changed, for better and for worse, but mostly for worse. There were some balances and some new stuff added (mostly paid things mind you) and I can safely say that this is the last time I'm touching this game. Ever.For starters, it feels much more tilted towards paying players rather than regular players. To a very annoying degree, I wouldn't even put it past Bethesda/Direwolf to have programmed (this is possible, don't even try to deny it) some feature of matching up non paying players with paying players in ranked or otherwise to entice them to pay up for better cards to win with. I abstained from ever buying anything on this game with real money, and I am estatic that I did, because it's not worth it and I don't condone the behaviour Bethesda and (possibly) Direwolf has been sporting in this game and (in Bethesda's case) in general. All in all, this game really isn't anything special, and isn't too great unless you're willing to fork over a few dollars to be able to stand a fighting chance against many of the better decks people will have made from bought decks or will have bought. Lastly, theres one thing that seems to need a change yet refuses to change. The accessability of building a guard based deck, guard cards are nice and all, but when you're going up against someone who's deck is primarily guards and buff action cards, then you start to feel like you're smacking your head against a brick wall, hoping to demolish it. I don't have the time or patience or even money to 'git gud' at a game that prioritzes players' money over their skill or competence.--------This game has the potential to be fun. It really does, sadly it's not quite at such a potential yet. The ranked leaves much to be desired, the other main features are just pay 2 play up the♥♥♥♥♥♥ and most of the time in ranked, you'll end up with someone 2 or 3 ranks above you who has spent 18 bucks on the best cards for their pack, that will decimate you. Its sad really, because I kinda enjoy this game. But trust me, ranked can be a struggle, and it's the only mode thats technically free and actually gives rewards like septims and cards (with a rare chance of a pack). The steam trading cards require you to spend REAL MONEY, something that should be outright banned on steam as it is, but I see they don't quite give enough ♥♥♥♥s to care...Regardless, if any devs are reading this (HA, I highly doubt that) you have a great potential to make this better than hearthstone. Don't ♥♥♥♥ up. Just listen to some of the fans, improve what needs improving. I do think that its nice that I can buy certain full decks with Septims as oppose to money, thats a very very good thing considering too many games force you to use real money on ANYTHING and EVERYTHING in games nowadays. But I digress, ranked can be fixed a bit, and maybe balance the cards a bit? Make many decks less overpowered, and make it more worthwhile to make a custom deck using cards exclusive to bought decks?(UPDATED) So when you get to a milestone in ranked, they made a midway point for you, once you hit said milestone, if you lose a battle, you go down a rank, leading into this really stupid midrank that you can very easily get stuck in if you erratically win and lose. I feel like this is lazy and honestly could be fixed too.(UPDATE 2) Okay, I learned that custom decks are really absurdly broken. So, if you were to make what I call a 'SWAT Team' deck, where you use mainly guard cards and item cards that boost attack and defense, you have a 85% chance to basically ruin anyone you come across. Theres actually several cards that really need to be debuffed, and actually have turned me off of this game. I'll list a few, Golden Saint (if you know this card, you can see how it can be a match ruiner), Ring of Imaginary Might (couple this with any guard with regenerate and a defense up or two and your opponent is screwed), and Royal Guard is also a really powerful card. Regardless, many of the most powerful cards require you to fork over 12 - 18 bucks of your (or your mother's if you're a young child who pesters their parents for money like a leech sucking blood) money, thus making the game have the illusion of being fair, until you get into the meat (or lack there of) and find a Pay 2 Win game with many features locked behind paywalls.SO, would I recommend this game? No. Not even a little bit, hell, even Hearthstone is better than this."

I made it negative, because even though I really do like the game, I hate all of the new updates. They make the game worse with every one of them. They added Flak, LOML, and worst of all the Proto Seeker (all three of which are weapons that need no skill at all, since two of them are lock on and the flak has a huge explosion radius). They removed Megabots. And lastly, they added crates and removed RP (which makes it nearly impossible to get the parts that you need).Robocraft used to be a great game, but now it\'s ruined.\""I completely agree with this, the removal of megabots is possibly one of the most rediculous things Freejam could have done, It is stating, in my opinion, \""♥♥♥♥ the players who farmed for hours to get ingame currency to buy endgame gear which took many hard working, stressful hours and instead lets make it so everyone struggles together to achieve less than they were aiming for unless they pay us lots of money!\"" Alas this is my opinion and seeing how FreeJam currently is, they won\'t bother looking towards the community for opinions."

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.  THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more. MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.   ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle. CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer:  Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death. OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.   PLAY FOR FREE: PlanetSide 2 is free to play with optional in-game purchases.

Very addicting and brings a lot to the table, especially for being free. However, I'm starting to get annoyed with constantly getting booted and losing all of my progress due to the saving method essentially being waypoints. I haven't been able to progress through the story much for the last two days because everytime I try, the server disconnects (and no, it's not my computer or internet connection). Another thing to keep in mind, you might as well play the windowed version and keep a browser up in the background because you will constantly be searching for vendor recipes, etc. It's interesting that it doesn't have one base currency like so many other games, but can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes with such limited inventory space. I hope you like Tetris because you will be playing a lot of it in this game. It'd also be nice to have auras and certain summons not take up skill slots in order to be used. I know some people like the challenge, but I would rather have access to more skills. That being said, it is a fun game with A LOT of content and you don't have to pay to win...but you may have to invest in more stash tabs.

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.  THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more. MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.   ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle. CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer:  Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death. OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.   PLAY FOR FREE: PlanetSide 2 is free to play with optional in-game purchases.   ",2014.0,"Beating up people in spandex suits, taking down tyranical leaders and putting freedom in the word enjoyment.

",2015.0,"Early Access ReviewActual for V-buildOk i will try to summ up things:Wouldn't suggest it to anyone because of atrocious grinding and poor economy. Imbalanced FPS and RTS part being almost broken.Used to be a good game at closed beta but then dev team went full retard and way too greedy.So in generally speaking it's P2W at its finest. Some people may tell you that it's pay to skip grind but its just a half of the truth. First of all because if you will try to grind for something decent to be on the same lvl with guys beating you like grinding for weapon or badge it will take you days and even month for some stuff.Just one example to show you the atrociusness of grinding:""As it stands, it's now roughly 1706 hours of continuous biking to run through the Physical training badge. (at a rate of roughly 1200 per hour, I'm sure someone has a more accurate value.) 71 days, specifically. Bronze is 5.8 hours (reasonable). Silver is 105 hours, or 4.5 days (that's pretty ridiculous). ""If you buy stuff with gold you can get machinegun or heavy tank instantly. Nuff said.Some people may say but you still have to grind ribbon to modify your weapon like making an ohk rifle. Yup but with gold you can boost your progress like x2 or something like that and it still take an f2p player month to get something decent(remember my example) moreover you have to maintean  your weapon and  most likely you will went broke with most of weapons but if someone buying gold or premium he will be able to keep his weapon which for example can oneshot people but your gun needs 2 shots to kill anyone.This pretty sums up the game.The game could be good BF clone for ""poor"" people but instead of it it tries to squeeze all your money like an angry mobster.Moreover the game have been Beta for years.

At least Hearthstone lets you earn broken card packs through daily challenge but with the Elder Scrolls: Legends you actually have to pay REAL MONEY to earn them. A very good chuck of the cards are locked behind a paywall which is honestly the worst thing you can do in a game especially when those cards are INSANELY GOOD.Positives:- Low card count makes the game easier for new players- Campaign mode for offline/learning opportunities - Multiple combinations of classes.- Rewards for playing.- Ability to recycling unwanted cards.- Ranked gamemode with seasonal rewards.- It's free.Negatives:- Low card count means less variety in builds.- Campaign mode would insult anyone seriously invested in the current lore.- Classes are a dead giveaway of what the player is building. Some classes are clearly better than others.- Rewards aren't good, most of the time they give out unwanted duplicates.- Card recycling gives out terrible returns.- Ranked play isn't ranked. Everyone starts out at rank 0 so pros get paired with new players and it's a terrible experience for everyone involved.- Microtransactions everywhere. Heavy reliance on gambling.Inherent Negatives with this Genre:- Too much reliance on RNG.- Quick play doesn't search for fairness, it searches for speed.

",2018.0,Early Access ReviewPurchased founders due to a lot of the promises that came from the dev and emissaries around what they were going to do differently in this region. None of these promises were true. You basically have emissaries who are either fanboys/liars and people now who know the truth and are speaking up about it. I thought it was very odd they were not doing a beta event or any sort of testing in this region and this is why.Performance is abysmal on 1700x and Vega 64 gets sometimes 15 FPS in towns and can barely reach 60 other times. Translation is horrendous and you are going to have no idea what your moves do. This is nothing more than a cash grab don't do it and stay with another mmo. I appreciate steam for honoring the refund for a broken game and the devs lieing to the players.

The original one had and Experience progress system where you unlock different weapons and lbocks with exp you earn, after which you could buy these blocks with creddits you would earn or with money. During the building of your bot your tier level would increase, which would influance which opponents would roughly be searched for to go up against. Battle were fought somewhere between 10 v 10 or 12 vs 12, but could be randomized (like 6 vs 9) depending on how strong the bots were. Battle was fought world of tanks style. One life, one enemy base, one friendly base, and go.New version has different battle modes, of which the main mode is a conquest based map with 3 different points to capture, and respawn enabled. There is no Exp system, and no tier system. you have a maximum of 2000 points to use, that's it. Blocks can be bought, with points (slowly earned or recycled for with parts you own.. don't know the numbers but seems like 20% or so of it's original worth) or with money. they can also be earned with... our all time favorite ..... lootboxes. Now, the reason i came back to the new steam version was because i remember Really enjoying the old verison. And to be fair, although i would rather battle multiple enemies at once and retry next round, the new battle mode is still fun, going around with bots. Building is still the same (appart from the tiering stuf), and it's fun to build. However, what put me off was the ridiculous amount off ..... I would describe it as ""Rubbing it in"" that you are not currently a paying customer.Some examples:When recycling your unwanted parts for dust points it blinks on screen that you would get 4 times as much dust if you were premium.When opening lootboxes, which you do get at a fair rate (1-2-3 a match), you open 8 blocks, weapons, etc. off those, you receive the bottom 4, the top four are closed off with a neat sign saying Unlock with premium.I would say i am resistent in buying these things and only spend money when i am certain the developers deserve it, more as a donation then actually buying the stuff presented. But this game forces me to evaluate if i should not spend my money on there every 10 minutes.In short, Fun game, went in the wrong direction, still fun but not worth the trouble if you don't intend to get premmium."

I played Magic the Gathering for 14 years before the Vintage / Legacy player scene in my city got too toxic for me to tolerate - sold all my cards and cashed out.  I tried Hearthstone but like many attest, it's too dumbed-down for me.  It feels like checkers and I want to play chess. So then someone turned me onto Eternal.  I haven't played a game of Magic in 3 years and I've now spent almost 6 straight hours playing this -- I'm hooked!  It's got the feel of Magic's rich strategy and synergy-heavy card types, with the admittedly gorgeous artwork and sound design and intuitive interface of Hearthstone.  It's also very easy to get new cards - no pay to win, here.  I've already gotten 6 free decks and 6 free boosters just for playing the quests and ranked games, and enough in-game gold to buy 5 more boosters if I want.I think this is going to be the next big thing.  This game rules.  I'm so happy. :)"

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.  THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more. MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.   ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle. CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer:  Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death. OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.   PLAY FOR FREE: PlanetSide 2 is free to play with optional in-game purchases.

I did play this game at good length on mobile version, but I stopped when I got a new phone and... yeah ...So anyway, it was good distraction. I did spend about $25 or so into it because I did feel it earn my money. Now do I regret it? I suppose you can say yes. Why? Well, be warned. Should your PC EVER to crash mid game, be prepared to say good-bye to your 50+ fully stats dwellers. I did not how how ""significant"" it causes, especially when people like me, did not know the importance of backing up data. I was sure Steam-Cloud is reliable, but not for this game it seems ... That $25 bucks went down the drain and can't never be used again, even for new vaults. (No really, I don't really care or its a big deal, but you know?)This happened almost a month ago and I decided no more playing this product (or any ANY mobile-related games, even on my phone to play with).

What’s more, the component models can be manipulated, both individually and as assemblies.  The camera controls (e.g. pan, tilt, zoom, track, etc.) allow fly-throughs of the models from any perspective, even those that would prove impractical in reality.  There are also cutaway views and several levels of x-ray views, in addition to the lovingly rendered photorealistic finishes.  What’s more, the actions of each model have been animated, and the animations can be run at normal speed or a number of slow-motion speeds, with any of the views!  This allows study of the ingenious mechanisms (e.g. springs, levers, cams, index wheels, gas porting, etc.) at a level simply unavailable anywhere outside the digital realm.The game aspect of WoG involves dismantling and reassembling the guns, with challenges based on speed and accuracy.  There is also a shooting range, although only a few of the guns can be used for target shooting.Some of the models allow alternative parts to be fitted, such as different size magazines and custom grips, and some allow you to mount accessories such as suppressors and scopes.  There is also a paint mode, where budding graphic designers and modellers can create custom skins for the models.The firearms catalogue is quite extensive and growing all the time, with community voting used to decide which models should be developed next.  The majority of the catalogue is not initially available, being unlocked with experience points earned by performing tasks with the unlocked models.  It is possible to purchase the entire library, but I would not recommend doing so immediately, as the higher complexity models will be very daunting before developing some familiarity with the system.  It appears that there are also other, non-firearm models available for purchase, such as automobiles and animal skeletons, but I have not explored this.  There is also a significant body of community-created content available via the Steam Workshop.I recommend that anybody with even a remote interest in firearms or mechanical engineering download and try WoG.  The price is impossible to argue with, and there is a chance that it will prove fascinating."

As an AQW player, I always wondered how it would look like. This game somehow still resonates with me. It's true, there is a lot of grinding for XP, but the players I've met were friendly and didn't hesitate to help with the ""harder"" bosses. (I've reached the maximum level, which is 20 atm, in about 2 weeks so it's not that bad) There is also the story so they aren't really that boring. Take my advice, farm in Ashfall (dragonslayer area), you get high XP from the quests there, and weapons.I like the fact that this is crossplatform, and it even remembers your quest progress if you log off before finishing the quest. A fun game to play when you're not home as well, from your phone. You can play on your computer and then continue the quest on your Android phone, for example.Btw, it's full of Spanish people, so if you know their language you're in luck, but also people from UK, US and other places. Many of them are on twitter, and I like the fact that most of the fanbase are old aqw players, so the average player is older than AQW's playerbase.There are guilds/groups, if you're interested in that. And many Discord servers."

I would fight other bots that resembled bad♥♥♥♥♥futuristic tanks, air and ground walkers, and bots that ressembled creations out of movies like star wars or halothere was balance in chasis cubes.  And i dont mean just the cubes i also mean armor.  You would see decent builds with a little bit of armor for protection and overall have a balanced fight in a matchHowever ive started to play again for a few matches and i was upest to find some of the keythings that made this game fun...are while not gone, slowly being used less than they originally wereI see more armored turtles with guns poking out in a match then i see a decently built, creative, cool looking battle machine these days and i think that is mostly because armor has gotten far too important in building a robotNothing seems to be balanced anymore in terms of creativity and building balance of cubes and its really upsetting because this was and still can be a really fun game to play and i dont want to see it go down the tubes just because the development teams dont do anything to bring the creativity back.That stuff on the new cover for the game is never seen in a real match.  Because if it were it would be incinerated by hovering builds covered head to toe in armor.  The creativity to make robots is still very much in the game but the matchs themselves make it impossible to win with these creative bots because they get destroyed by these other robots that are covered in parts so high in defense that they shread you to pieces before you can do some damage.So if the development team(s) ever read this then please do something about balancing out these parts so that it is not impossible to win a game creativly.  And to the people reading this review i say to give robocraft a try, its not a bad game it just can be frustrating at times.  But if you find you' re always getting frustrated and always getting destroyed in matches, then i would reccomend to just  play something else and stay updated on robocraft to see if the dev's fix these problems that have been occuring.And if you dont feel like waiting then im sorry robocraft has disappointed youthese are just my opinions on the game so please dont harass or synically bash me over the head through the internet because im trying to helpful while still positive for a game i really want to pull through."

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.  THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more. MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.   ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle. CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer:  Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death. OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.   PLAY FOR FREE: PlanetSide 2 is free to play with optional in-game purchases.   ",2016.0,"Give it a try; it is free.No idea what to do? Play Engineer or Medic at first: you will earn a lot of XP and stay behind your allies, giving you a chance to see what others do without dying as often (you will die a lot).Feel overwhelmed? Look for an outfit, they'll show you the ropesHow do you know which outfit is good?Look around the map which outfits captured a lot of bases, apply to join these outfits.DISCLAIMER: You still want to stay away from zergfits, like Angels of Death. If they have more than 1000 members, then better stay away. Additionally you can check outfit stats at http://www.planetside-universe.com/. Generally speaking I would recommend to go with an outfit that has less than 500 members, more than 40% activity rate within the last month and an average level above 60; those are the guys that you want to hang out with."

If you are happening apon this, then I've played this game a little bit too much since I got it so many years ago, and many accounts have come and gone. If you add up all my hours from my corrupted accounts, I've wasted around 1,760+ hours on this magnificent game. Let me clear something up; hours mean nothing, I'm still at the skill level of a f2p. I still play for one definitive reason: I like the spy waaay to much. But in all seriousness, this game is amazing. All this bull about how meet your match ruined the game (I'm still a little salty about the Über update) and how Overwatch killed it is nothing but lies. Tf2 is one of those games that stays fun because of the community. WoW for example, follows this exactly. Tf2 has been around for 10 freakin years. Even if Valve isn't the utopian company we all want it to be, this game will keep on going. I've seen a lot of my friends and veterans leave Tf2 or steam altogether for good, but more players still download it. I absolutely love the community, it's one of the main reasons this has and always will be my favorite game of all time. But we discourage f2ps from playing the game, which means they won't be spending any money on the game (which, let's face it, is the only thing keeping Valve with Tf2) and will never get any better. We can't keep scaring off the new players, or else Tf2 won't even have a future. Like I said before, no one but some of my bored friends will read this review, but if you've happened apon it then you know that these facts are true. Tf2 is dying. Valve isn't gonna do much about it, so we as a community have to band together to save it. I'm not a famous YouTuber, but I'll still try my best to keep this message going.Well, I just wasted a bunch of time writing a review that no one will read, but it felt good to get a definitive one out there, instead of the short ones I've written in the past.2007/10, is and always will be.

I'm gonna go for an unbiased review of this, but it may end up being a tad bit biased without me realizing it. Without further ado, I'm gonna just jump right in.Pros: 1. Fun (but occasionally repetitive) gameplay          2. Decent graphics and visual effects         3. Really nice character design and backstories         4. Great diversity in combat styles for certain charactersCons: 1. Slightly P2W          2. Certain overpowered classes (looking at you CrA and DiE)          3. Terrible economy          4. Moderately buggy at times          5. The majority of the pvp community is bad (this one is a bit of a gripe but it still remains true)These sum up most of the major points, but there is a lot more to go in detail about. First things first, if you wanna play this game seriously, it's pretty much unavoidable to not spend money at some point. It won't be too much, but the major thing that's locked behind a paywall is the skill slot change medal. When you start out, you only have 4 skill slots, and getting that medal unlocks the other 4. It's $9 worth of k-ching to buy it, and even though you won't need it for some, the majority of classes benefit greatly from it, with some needing it as a necessity. There are some events that will give you a free permanent medal, but those don't happen too often, so you would probably end up waiting several months for one of those events. Besides that, there's nothing else you ""need"" to spend money on, although it's pretty obvious they made the skill quests extremely grindy to push you towards just buying the skill you need instead of doing the respective quest(s) for it. The quest for most second job changes takes quite a bit as well, taking as long as a couple of weeks for people who play casually (Note: this does not include ALL 2nd job changes quests). As for the rest of the game, even though there are some negatives, the gameplay makes it worth it. It's really fun to play, and even though there's a pretty sharp learning curve that happens around level 46, that's what makes it fun. Even replaying through the various areas as different characters, levelling them up can prove a completely different experience depending on which classes you've played already.Graphics: 8Soundtrack: 7.5Gameplay: 9.5Bugs: 7Overall: 8Verdict: Even though there are some definitely noticeable flaws, the P2W factor isn't too high and it's worth at least a shot in my eyes.

",2018.0,"Been playing this game since 2014, little less than 4 years now, took a break during breach and prophecy league as I was playing other games. I never once doubted that GGG would keep developing a great game and trying it back during Closed beta, I knew that they would bring us an ARPG bringing us the D1 and D2 vibes that D3 failed to bring. Now sitting in 2018 I was glad I stuck with this game and supported them through buying supporter packs and mtx from the cash shop. For new players I believe that the games learning curve has gotten easier with the ammount of guides from the community and GGG's own little tutorial at the beginning of a new character. Although the curve to get into the game has gotten easier the challenge of earning currency, building a great character, and the endgame hasn't gotten any easier infact even harder. True POE has builds that make the game's content look like a joke and there will always be a meta, but the fun the game brings through running maps at endgame or simply leveling through acts 1-10 hasn't changed. I haven't always played on Steam as there was client issues in multiple leagues so my hours haven't all been on record but I will say I have atleast 3k+ total hours and counting in this game and plan on many more.If people are doubting whether the game is truly free to play look at other reviews, go into the game yourself or even just watch videos. The game is truly free, it bring no advantage to those who support the cash shop is strictly cosmetic and convenience. What I do recommend for a player willing to spend money in this game is catch the sales they have weekly and always buy on sale, they run multiple stash tab sales and you should only really buy when they are on sale unless you are 1st starting out. I highly recommend buying 1 currency tab, 1 quad tab, 1 map tab, and 1 premium tab. Essence, Divination, and Fragment tabs are pure convenience and really are only for those who truly want a tab for all the small things. If you cant spend 20$ on a game you can enjoy for hours at a time and can put down and comeback later and still find new content or continue on standard then you shouldn't be playing a f2p game at all.To close this wall of text, I recommend any new player who enjoys ARPG, and the d1 and d2 to try this game, if you are simply wanting to cure your itch for Lost Ark or whatever other new ARPG coming out in the future POE is a great way to do so. If you just simple enjoy ARPG and want a fair cash shop, crazy build customization, and hours of fun then download and start playing."

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.  THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more. MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.   ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle. CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer:  Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death. OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.   PLAY FOR FREE: PlanetSide 2 is free to play with optional in-game purchases.   ",2012.0,"A new spin to the FPS genre that successfully beats out both its competitors; COD And Battlefield.

Taking into consideration the devs and their actions also the track this game is heading down it could have been great at what it was designed to do but the devs failed the fans and the fans failed to push the devs. From the beginning there were numerous server issues. A few years ago there was a point when the game was basically unplayable. Also the devs love micro transactions so much they turned this game into the equivelent of a slot machine in las vegas. Micro Transactions can be ok if they come in small quantites but when the game is built on them its a bit exsessive. With the hours of all of me and my friends combined we have close to around 2300 hours. And its safe to say we are all displeased with how the game has turned out. The one shimmering light in the void that is this game is the great community it has. Over the years throughout its popularity and the decline recently the community has be a constant bright spot for the game and one of the best i have experienced, The people may be patient but the devs will be the death of this game."

It does not allow the complex interactions, counterspells, and control features of magic that appeal to many magic players, and also does not bring the random rng elements of hearthstone that appeal to hearthstone players. Its a game for people who want to play creatures and smash face without worrying too much about being punished for doing so. There are control elements, but with each passing set the creature decks have more and more tools to combat the control style decks. What has resulted from these design decisions is a game about creature-based combos and creatures decks. If you desire a more magic like experience with control and interaction, this may not be for you. "

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.  THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more. MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.   ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle. CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer:  Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death. OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.   PLAY FOR FREE: PlanetSide 2 is free to play with optional in-game purchases.   ",2016.0,"I am an original planetside player, and played fanatically. 3 years after ps2 released and I finally have a computer that could run it so I just had to give it a try. I miss some of the old mechanics, but the heart of the game is there. I even bought a three month daybreak pass for the genes and to support the game and have found it well worth it. Very enjoyable with some great firefights to be had even on off hours. I had a real tough time for my first few hours, but after you get last the learning curve there is a ton of fun to be had here.

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.  THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more. MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.   ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle. CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer:  Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death. OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.   PLAY FOR FREE: PlanetSide 2 is free to play with optional in-game purchases.   ",2018.0,"Been playing this game since the Beta, and I can easily say there's nothing else like it. Steam has a fraction of my hours, since I used the launcher for many years, but you can see the total here: https://www.planetside2.com/players#!/5428010618040832017I really like this game. There's a lot of flaws, for example, the game is combined arms, and Air vs Air, Ground vs Ground, and Infantry vs Infantry all feel very fleshed out and well crafted, but where they mix often feels precariously balanced. Sometimes infantry dominate over vehicles, and sometimes aircraft can destroy infantry with no fear of retaliation. However, the game features an insanely dedicated Dev team who are very receptive to the community, and the game is constantly getting patches and updates. If you're looking for a game to sink your teeth into, especially if you're looking for a social fix with your shooter, I can firmly say PlanetSide 2 is the only game on the market that can really deliver."

Konami Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd. provides a Trading Card Game (TCG) and video games, based on the ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" anime series created from the original manga, that are enjoyed around the world.",2018.0,"For players new to yugioh and wanting to learn I don't recommend taking this game too seriously. As for the duelists who know what they're doing, who have played stuff like Dragon Rulers/Hands-Artifacts-Traptrixes/Teleport-Dark Armed Dragons/Scapegoat-Metamorphosis-Thousand Eyes Restrict lock/Whatever deck you name it/Anything from the actual game really; Those guys who know what I'm talking about - I don't think they are going to take this game seriously either. My advice is: Forget synchro forget xyz forget pendulum forget deckbuilding and forget yugioh because this is not the yugioh you knowThis game gets good reviews because of nostalgia and voices and Kaiba memes (I admit I too, picked this up at first for the nostalgia and memes) and while I appreciate that, the fact of the matter is the gameplay in terms of the logistics and cards leaves much to be desired.I'm Kaiba and I start the game with a random deck that does nothing. Let us examine one of the most powerful (*gasp*) cards in this deck named ""Blue-Eyed Silver Zombie"", a Normal Monster with 900ATK/700DEF played in 3 copies in the deck. As of this moment I am having a seizure on the floor bawling my brains out at this monster's titanic 900 attack stat. To express my completely unbiased, sincere evaluation of this card in all honesty I impart the following words: This card sucks balls. I'm sorry but Kaiba you will never be the next king of games with your fourth rate deckbuilding skills and fifth rate cards. Do yourself a favor, toss it in the chiller where it belongs next to your ""Frog the Jam"" and ""Mushroom Man #2"".It is to my understanding that a deck can only contain up to 3 copies of the same card. Why is it that these boxes have 8, 9, 10 of the same card in them, not to mention they're all really bad. In fact 90% of all the cards there are either useless or will have no immediate use in your deck. Going through all the boxes seeing what cards were in them was an exercise in cringing since the only 'ok' cards I 'might' consider using are found in quantities of 1x and 2x mixed with all these 8x, 9x and 10x cards I'm only going to throw away. I can open a dozen packs right now and the best card in my deck will still be Blue Eyed Silver Zombie. Even some of the rarer cards aren't even good: Mirage Knight is Super Rare in this game? I bet there's going to be some guy who rips open who knows how many packs for that Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys, but winds up getting Mirage Knight instead and then kills themselves the next day. I figured the best thing to do since everything sold is so bad is to not buy anything at all.Yo this crappy p2w mobile game is making big bucks off you guys while half the cards in this game (including the ones considered 'good') can be physically bought for less than 50 cents at a real world store where real cards are being sold. Like, In the physical universe. These players know that, right?? Save lives - You can get a Super Rare Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys for 49 cents online. In all seriousness it's just a bit bizarre to imagine people shelling out in this game when you can hit up an online store and buy singles or get a real deck (in both a literal and figurative sense).To those that are new to yugioh and want to learn the Yugioh trading card game, I would only suggest using this as a tool, and only as a tool, just to learn the ropes and get the basics down. Do understand that this game doesn't have all the cards, and decks you see in this game aren't what people are playing out there in the real Yugioh TCG."

(I really hate it) - Lags - OP Tanks with sniper rifle accuracy - Planes that bombs with sniper rifle accuracy and shot down all paratroopers all the time (para planes has no defence) - You can feel a lil bit Pay-2-Win there (some minor stuffs, but may be useful) - Cheaters (they also exist in this game) - Small ammount of maps (and some of them like Airport are really terrible to play) - Too many vehicles... - Maps are big, but they feel empty (almost no covers) - In most situations, the higher fire rate, the better weapon (hail the MG42) - So far I've noticed that German weapons are the best (where's balance here?)Hmm... I may missed some but anyway...

However, Brawlhalla isn't a limited ""free-to-play"" game (Even though it says free-to-play, it's not your standard wizard101 or WoW definition). You have access to everything everybody else does with the exception of cosmetic items, meaning P2W isn't a Brawlhala feature. The only way to ""win"" at the game is to play and develop your skills.

",2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWell having played the game for only a couple of days, I can not give a comprehensive review.  I can however speak regarding the the more constant complaints.   Take them with a grain of salt.  The people complaining seem mostly hung up on things that I do not see.  Crying that the game is too hard now because they nerfed damage output is chief among them currently.  Having played the game before and after this change, I can say that the game was far too easy before the change, and if I am honest I still find it quite easy afterwards, but at least players need to pay attention now, previously short of playing blindfolded it was not challenging at all.   Another common complaint is optimisiation.  Again I do not see it.  I am able to play the game cleanly on medium (3) everything with 50-60 fps @4k.  This is better then I expected given that my video card is a r9 390x, and typically takes a dump playing with 4k resolution.  If there is a point to this babbling it is this.  Unhappy people cry and complain, satisfied people don't.  Keep that in mind when reading the complaints.  Hopefully the devs do not cave too much to the criers and ruin the game trying to appease them.  Not everyone wants everything handed to them, not everyone wants to go from lvl 1 to level cap in a day, but the people who do are happy to vocalize how much it sucks when they can't.  There are balance issues pvp wise from what I can tell, and there is content that still needs to be added, there is work yet to do.  Thats why they call it early access, this is to be expected, but thus far most of what seems to be wrong with this game is the people who play it."

Cool concept, definitely worth checking out, but needs workJust looking at the Menu is quite sweet. Ships look beautiful.Yes, the ships are slow (especially the heavy ones), but it makes sense, since they are HUGE BATTLE ships and not tiny fighter ships. It get´s quite enjoyable once you figure out how to properly fly the ships - saddly the tutorial is very barebones. I actually read the tutorial PDF manual, but until I unlocked PvP, I had no idea you can fire all weapons at the same timeThe bigger problem with the game is the lack of players. You will have to grind Coop vs AI matches for hours to learn how to play the game. If you actually dare to go into PvP, you will get horribly f****d, becuase the people that still play it will fly circles around you, and melt you in seconds.One more problem is that if you go PvP with friends, you will be split into opposite teams...Look devs, splitting up friends is not a good formula. If we get smashed, then so be it. We´ll practice and try again, but if you divide friends, nobody will keep wanting to play the game. I would keep playing if: 1) They add some PvE maps solo or coop maps, I would definitely play itIf ""Elite Dangerous"" would have spaceships like this game, then I would play ""Elite Dangerous"" (which is basically Euro Truck simulator in space)2) OR - they add a COOP with a smarter AIThe Coop missions are way to easy, while PvP matches are harsh and take long to find3) OR - make the FTL jump sound and feel cool (check ""Everspace"" for comparrison)The game´s biggest selling point IMO is the big♥♥♥♥♥ powerful and cool spaceship feel.

You have the new players who probably think this could be a great game, if they worked on a few things (things that have existed in the past, and have since been done away with).  You then have the old players, the ones who put a lot of effort to get that last bit of RP to get the next piece of hardware, to hopefully lift you to the next tier.

An excellent pvp multiplayer game that's best played with a premade group of 5 for maximum teamwork and coordination. Just prepare for lots of grinding to unlock that new, shiny battleship. Pros:Gameplay is fun and exciting. Sounds and visuals are excellent, exactly what you would want out of a full-scale space battle.Cons: Some of the controls are a little out of place, but the majority of movement and weapon commands are easy and straightforward. Communication system with teammates could use some work, as you have to be isolated from combat to effectively communicate without a headset."

",2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is possibly one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. There are so many things that are wrong with this game. Weapons like the Springfield rifle that kill instantly but the starter guns take a whole clip to kill. As far as progression for guns and ranks goes you won't get very far until your hand over a considerable amount of cash. Most of the guns and vehicles are intentionally made expensive so you have to buy them with actual cash. There are a lot of players who complain and whine whenever they lose a game. They even have the nerve to verbally assault their teammates as if it is their team's fault that the fool keeps running into the same sniper or machine gunner that killed him the past 30 times. America might as well not have any tanks because they are all worthless. The Panther apparently does as much damage as a tank destroyer. Oh and don't forget about all of those anti-tank terrorists who ride up on motorcycles and blow themselves up on your tank. Be prepared for ultimate spawn camp grinding and good luck even getting out of your spawn. Grenades can apparently blow people into outer space. HE tank shells are an absolute waste of your time and money as they really don't do much you are better off just using your machine gun. And how about the Jeeps and motorcycles? They handle like they are on a Slip 'N Slide. All of the locations you fight in are basically the same maps with the slightest of variations in the objectives. You will no doubt find yourself bored to tears after you played the same map of the same town 5 consecutive times. The matchmaking takes an eternity to find a match to put you in even though there are available matches. If the enemy is short a player be prepared to deal with the totally spectacular team respawn queue because we all just love waiting. If you think the queue is bad try waiting to respawn after you accidentally crashed into a tree and blew up because of the horrible vehicle handling. On the generals side of everything the assault teams cost a lot of warfunds. Not only are they expensive but they also have to go through a queue which again we all just love waiting. However if you're lucky and you troops actually make it through the queue which is controlled by other players then you have to select a city to deploy them at. Once they are deployed you have to send them to a battle or initiate one yourself. Sounds amazing right? Except your armies are slower than a slug. But most of the time if you are a new general your squads will almost never see the light of day. I hope there are some major changes regarding these issues but until that day comes we are stuck with what could have had potential to be a great game.

",2018.0,"I do not recommend this game for the following reasons:- there are discontinued overpowered items in the game (standard league), new players will realistically speaking never attain these, old players brag about these in the global chat and/or on videos;- there are items with a droprate so low they're deemed mythical, grinding your♥♥♥♥♥off for these items is not fun at all;- the game is hard to get into, it is required to download a 'loot filter' just to be able to distinguish crappy loot from good loot;- the trading system is clunky, you are required to keep an internet browser open with a trading website to get the in-game name of someone who is selling whatever you want. The entire trading system being outside the game is just stupid and allows players to write simple tools to gain an unfair advantage in trading.However, there are certainly ways to still enjoy this game:- after completing the main storyline, run a couple of maps whenever you feel like it;- the temporary leagues do not include the discontinued items. However, at the end of each league your character gets transfered to standard;- the loot filters are completely customisable, which is nice. Even the drop sounds for specific items can be set to your liking.Overall, I do not recommend this game to anyone who values his/her time."

Don't expect sometnig new from it, we've seen everything it has to offer 100 times before. TDM maps are mostly small, and designed for fast and agressive CQB, even if all of them have some kind of a sniper-designated area. Demolition/Assasination/Battle modes maps are a little bigger and will give you some breathing space. Not too much though. The real problem of the game, is the lack of a new content. I mean it's in development, so it has to get new stuff regulary, right? I was playing it for a year or so, and all new stuff i've seen was 1(one) new map and a sh**load of skins for guns/grenades/melee weapons. I'm an occasional player, meaning i can play 1 or 2 matches a day, sometimes not playing for couple of days at all, so i'm not too bored yet. But if you going to play it more often keep that in mind. Still, the game is well balanced and polished, it's fun to play. I'm an aggressive Submachinegun-runner type of a guy, so it'suits me well. Also a good thing is they don't lie about pay-to-win, real money won't give you any kind of advantage, ALL of the guns available for Bullets(real time money) can be bought for ingame currency that is earned really fast. So, in my opinion it's worth a try, it's free after all."

As it free to play, there are some boosters you can spend money on (and for this game this is completely optional).Pros:* Highly addictive (first month only)* familiar and cool graphics* proper micro and macro management (for no more than 20 dwellers)* payment content is not a stopper for F2P usersCons:* Once you reach high level, micromanagement is a mess* For a big collony you're easily lost in dwemmers and rooms* have to play every single day for max boost* no more fun end-game contentSummary: For fans it's a must-try, for others - yes, definitly try either.

A ranked game gets you matches against almost the exact same one or two decks over and over (I'm looking at you, Rakano armory) because everyone knows they have the strongest combinations of cards and if you're not playing those like everyone else you mostly just lose with the occasional lucky win due to power and removal draw.If you're just looking for something to play casually and pass the time for 5-10 minutes, by all means, go for it.

So a long time ago, I've started playing this game, when it was a much smaller game. At the time, I liked it, but it got boring so quickly, because I couldn't have fun memorizing the parts, that I was supposed to assamble. So long story short, I left it. Nowdays I came back, to see what the developers did, and made out of the game. I was a little bit suprized, when the game welcomed me, as a newcomer, because as I said, I did played the game already. So my progress whiped out... Oh well, I personally left the game on the 3rd gun I think, so I wasn't that upset about it. (Like the other ones, who actually loved this game, and spent hours of their lifetime assembling guns.) When I was searching for the next gun to check, I was shocked, how much models they created to assemble. (Not minding the fact, that I was only be able to play with 2, the tutorial one, and an another one.)So recommending this game would be missleading for those, who's following my reviews, because dear game developers, making us, players redo the tutorial is ok, but whiping our progress, and our achivements? This is one of that kind of wound, that's gonna remain in the hearts of your old fans forever."

The “release” version will be available shortly after Open Beta testing is complete. The Open Beta is an optional version of DCS World that we use to first test new content and technologies before moving them to our release version.Our dream is to offer the most authentic and realistic simulation of military aircraft, tanks, ground vehicles and ships possible. This free download includes a vast mission area of the Caucasus region and Black Sea that encompasses much of Georgia. It also includes a flyable Russian Sukhoi Su-25T ground attack aircraft and the famous WWII North American TF-51D fighter. An additional 25 aircraft are available for purchase.The download comes with one of the most powerful mission editor ever designed, full network play and more than 156 AI weapons systems, 105 ground vehicles and trains, 50 air defense systems, 19 ships and 84 AI aircraft permitting you to plan and play highly sophisticated missions. DCS World is massively extensible through additional DCS modules as well as user-made add-ons and mods which you can purchase and download from our site.DCS is a true ""sandbox"" simulation that is also designed to cover multiple time periods of interest such as WWII, Korean War, Vietnam, Gulf War and others. Current regions to battle include the Caucasus, Nevada Test and Training Range, and Normandy 1944. New maps in development include the Persian, Syria, Afghanistan, and others.DCS World is fundamentally a deep, authentic and realistic simulation designed also to offer a more relaxed gameplay to suit the user and his particular level of experience and training. The ambition is to hand hold users from novice pilot all the way to the most advanced and sophisticated operator of such complex weapons systems as the A-10C Warthog or the F/A-18C Hornet. The only next step is the real thing!Key features of DCS World 2.5:The most realistic Free-to-Play digital battlefield ever.One-of-a-kind, internally developed graphics engine that looks amazing from 0 to 80,000 feet. Includes a beautiful, free, and highly detailed map of the Caucasus region that includes south western Russia and Georgia.Includes millions of buildings, millions of km of usable roads and railways, more than 50 million trees, and 20 fully-equipped operational airbases.Includes 156 free and fully operational weapons systems, 105 ground vehicles, 19 ships and 84 AI-controlled aircraft.Fly the TF-51 Mustang and Su-25T attack jet for free!Play all DCS World modules from one DCS World version.State-of-the-art graphics with amazing lighting, shadows, and performance.New breathtaking effects for explosions, clouds, fog, fire, and smoke.

Play hundreds of missions and campaigns with new campaigns continually created.Both hardcore realistic and casual gameplay modes and options available. ",2016.0,"DCS World is a free to play extremely realistic flight simulator.The first thing I am going to mention is the ""DLC"". This isn't DLC even though Steam lists it as DLC. If you go to the website you will see them being called modules. They are each their own game but you need the base of DCS World to use them. Don't call them overpriced because for 50 USD each you can get an A-10c, Huey, FW-190, MI-8, Bf-109, MiG-21, MiG-15, or an F-86F Sabre. These are all modeled to the exact detail as the real plane. This means the buttons, switches, levers, and everything else can be used.One thing that bugs me about other reviews are the ones that get mad over the modules or the people that say the game is too realistic. Don't buy this game if you aren't willing to learn. It took me forever to understand this game and frankly I still don't. This simulator is not an arcade game.Pros-Great graphics after the update-Runs well-Extremely realistic-Satisfying-FunCons-Slightly unstable-Takes a while to load but this doesn't really matter "
