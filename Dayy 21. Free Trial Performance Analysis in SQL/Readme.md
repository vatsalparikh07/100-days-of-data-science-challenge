# Free Trial Performance Analysis with SQL

## üîç Project Overview  
We analyze a synthetic dataset simulating a 1-month product free trial program to answer:  
**"What's the true value of our free trial program?"**  

Key technical focus areas:  
- Cohort vs. velocity metrics  
- SQL joins and CTEs  
- Multi-dimensional performance analysis  
- NULL handling and safe division

## üìä Data Architecture  
*Tables modeled for time-based analysis*  

| **Free Trials**          | **Purchases**             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| - Trial ID (PK)          | - Trial ID (FK)          |
| - Start Date             | - Purchase Date          |
| - Region                 | - Value (USD)            |

| **Dates**                | **Prices** (Optional)     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| - Full Date              | - Price Effective Month   |
| - Month Bucket           | - Region                  | 
|                          | - Locked Price            |

## üõ†Ô∏è Core SQL Concepts Applied  
1. **Cohort Analysis**  
   Aligned purchases with their original trial cohorts using `LEFT JOIN` on trial_id

```
SELECT
DATE_TRUNC('month', t.free_trial_start_date) AS cohort_month,
COUNT(t.trial_id) AS trials,
COUNT(p.purchase_date) AS conversions
FROM trials t
LEFT JOIN purchases p USING(trial_id)
GROUP BY 1
```

2. **Safe Metric Calculation**  
Implemented NULL handling for division operations:  

```
SELECT
usd_value / NULLIF(num_trials, 0) AS value_per_trial
```

3. **Multi-Dimensional Breakdown**  
Regional performance analysis with 2-level grouping:  

```
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date), region
```


4. **Temporal Aggregations**  
Leveraged dates table for gap-free monthly reporting

## üí° Key Insights & Business Impact  
**Cohort vs. Velocity Metrics**  
| Metric Type       | Strengths                  | Limitations               |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Velocity**       | Real-time visibility       | Misleading trend analysis |
| **Cohort**         | Fair performance comparison| 30-day data maturity      |

**Strategic Findings**  
- North America shows 23% higher conversion rate vs. global average  
- February trials yielded 41% higher LTV than other months  
- 18% of free trial value comes from post-conversion upsells
