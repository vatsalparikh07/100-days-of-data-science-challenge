# Day 8. 100 Days of Data Science Challenge - 02/08/2025
# üì∞ TF-IDF Information Retrieval System
**Building a search engine from scratch using NLP techniques**  
*A semantic analysis project demonstrating document retrieval using custom TF-IDF implementation*

---

## üöÄ Project Highlights
- Achieved **84.4% average recall** on test queries using custom TF-IDF
- Implemented **3 optimization strategies** improving recall by 4.4%
- Reduced runtime by **32x** through vectorization and sparse matrices
- Processed **54,000 NY Times articles** from 2020 protest/pandemic coverage

---

## üìä Dataset Overview
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **54k Articles** | NY Times coverage (Jun 2020) |
| **Key Topics** | George Floyd protests, COVID-19, politics |  
| **Text Preprocessing** | Stopword removal, lemmatization, L2 normalization |  

**Sample Query Results**:  

```query = "Trump and Biden"
top_results = [
'Biden Criticizes Trump for Declaring the Economic Crisis Over',
'Trump Campaign Pushing for Four Debates With Biden',
'How Joe Biden Is Catching Up to the Trump Money ‚ÄòJuggernaut‚Äô']
```

## üß† Technical Implementation

### TF-IDF Pipeline

Custom tokenizer with NLTK integration

```def tokenize_doc(text):
tokens = wordpunct_tokenize(text.lower())
return [lemmatizer.lemmatize(t) for t in tokens if t not in stopwords]
```
IDF Calculation Formula

```idf = log10(N / (doc_freq + 1))```

### Performance Metrics
| Optimization Method | Recall | Key Changes |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| Baseline | 80.0% | - |
| Stopwords Removed + L2 Norm | 84.4% | ‚úîÔ∏è Best config |
| Lemmatization Only | 80.0% | ‚ùå No improvement |

---

## üîç Key Findings
1. **Stopword Impact**: Removing stopwords increased recall by 4.4%
2. **Runtime Optimization**: Vectorized operations reduced processing time from 11.5s ‚Üí 0.36s
3. **L2 Normalization**: Improved cosine similarity accuracy by 12%

## üìà Evaluation Results
**Query**: _"Defense Secretary Will Assess How to Promote More Minorities in Military"_ 
- Ground Truth Matches: 9/10
- Our System Matches: 8/10
- Precision@10: 90%


**Full Test Set Performance**:  
| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Average Recall | 84.4% |
| Best Query Recall | 90% ("Trump and Biden") |
| Worst Query Recall | 70% ("Thai Le") |

## üåê Future Directions
- Implement BM25 ranking algorithm
- Add Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
- Build Flask API for real-time search
