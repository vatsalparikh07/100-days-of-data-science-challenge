# 🦙 Fine-Tuning LLaMA for Customer Service Chatbots  

## 📌 Project Overview  

In this project, I fine-tuned a **LLaMA-based language model** to improve **customer service chatbots**.  
The objective was to create a **lightweight, efficient, and domain-specific chatbot** by using:  

✔️ **Dataset filtering & preprocessing** for chatbot training  
✔️ **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for efficient fine-tuning  
✔️ **Quantization (8-bit & 4-bit)** to reduce memory usage  
✔️ **Training optimization** with learning rate scheduling  
✔️ **ROUGE metric evaluation** for response quality

## 🗂 Datasets Used  

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **MedQuad-MedicalQnADataset** | Medical Q&A dataset for chatbot evaluation |
| **Bitext Customer Support Dataset** | Customer service Q&A dataset for fine-tuning |
| **Softage-AI Conversational Dataset** | Used for response generation & ROUGE evaluation |

## 🔧 **Key Components of the Project**  

### 🔹 **1. Preprocessing & Dataset Preparation**  

📌 **Goal:** Prepare data for fine-tuning the LLaMA model.  
📌 **Steps:**  
✅ Loaded the **MedQuad dataset**, selected **500 samples** for evaluation.  
✅ Merged **customer queries & intent labels** into a structured prompt format.  
✅ Saved & reloaded the **preprocessed dataset** for reuse in fine-tuning.  

📌 **Example of formatted input:**  
```plaintext
Query: What is the status of my order?
Intent: Check Order Status
```

### 🔹 **2. LoRA Fine-Tuning for Efficient Training**  

📌 **Goal:** Reduce computational cost while improving model adaptability for customer service chatbots.  

📌 **Approach:**  
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** was applied to reduce trainable parameters while maintaining model effectiveness.  
- Fine-tuning was focused on **specific transformer layers**, ensuring efficiency without modifying the entire model.  
- This method allowed **training on consumer GPUs** with significantly lower memory requirements.  

📌 **Outcome:**  
✔️ **Fine-tuned the model without excessive GPU overhead**.  
✔️ **Maintained performance comparable to full fine-tuning**.  
✔️ **Enabled quick adaptation to domain-specific queries**.

### 🔹 **3. Optimizing Model Size with Quantization (8-bit & 4-bit)**  

📌 **Goal:** Reduce **GPU memory consumption** while maintaining chatbot accuracy.  

📌 **Approach:**  
- **8-bit quantization** was applied to compress model weights while preserving key information.  
- **4-bit Normalized Quantization (NF4)** was used for even more aggressive compression, improving inference speed.  
- These techniques ensured the chatbot could run on **low-resource environments** without major performance trade-offs.  

📌 **Outcome:**  
✔️ **Reduced model size, improving deployment feasibility**.  
✔️ **Enabled faster response generation** without significant accuracy loss.  
✔️ **Allowed chatbot deployment on edge devices with limited computational power**.

### 🔹 **4. Evaluating Model Performance with ROUGE Score**  

📌 **Goal:** Measure how well the chatbot-generated responses align with human-labeled answers.  

📌 **Approach:**  
- **ROUGE-1** was used to assess **word overlap** between chatbot responses and reference answers.  
- Evaluation was performed on **a subset of 500 test queries** from the dataset.  
- The model’s **response quality was benchmarked** against pre-fine-tuned versions.  

📌 **Findings:**  
✔️ **Final ROUGE-1 Score: 0.1815** – Indicates reasonable overlap but room for improvement.  
✔️ **Better coherence compared to the base LLaMA model**.  
✔️ **Further fine-tuning on larger datasets could enhance response accuracy**.

## 📊 **Key Learnings & Insights**  

✔️ **Fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs** enhances chatbot effectiveness.  
✔️ **LoRA is a powerful method** for reducing fine-tuning costs without sacrificing accuracy.  
✔️ **Quantization techniques make large models more practical for deployment**.  
✔️ **Evaluation with ROUGE provides a quantitative measure of chatbot response quality**.

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**  

🔹 **Test different LoRA scaling factors** to balance efficiency and accuracy.  
🔹 **Expand the dataset** with more diverse customer service queries.  
🔹 **Compare performance between quantized and full-precision models**.  
🔹 **Fine-tune embeddings with GPT-4 for enhanced contextual understanding**.
